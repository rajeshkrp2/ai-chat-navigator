Chrome Extension Development Prompt: AI Chat Navigator
Overview
Create a Chrome extension called "AI Chat Navigator" that helps users navigate through long conversations in AI chat applications (ChatGPT, Claude, GrokAI, Bard, and Perplexity). The extension should extract user inputs from the conversation and display them in a collapsible sidebar for easy navigation.
Core Features

A collapsible sidebar that can be toggled via an extension icon and keyboard shortcut (Alt+N)
Display of user inputs with timestamps and preview text (first 10-15 words)
Ability to click on any input to scroll to that location in the chat
Search functionality to filter inputs by text content
Bookmarking capability for important inputs
Basic export functionality for selected inputs

Technical Requirements
Manifest and Structure

Use Manifest V3
Extension should be lightweight and performant
Include appropriate permissions for accessing content on the target sites only

Target Platforms Support

Implement platform detection and platform-specific content extraction for:

ChatGPT (chat.openai.com)
Claude (claude.ai)
GrokAI (grok.x.ai)
Google Bard/Gemini (gemini.google.com)
Perplexity (perplexity.ai)


Create an extensible framework that allows for adding more platforms with minimal code changes

UI Components

Sidebar Container:

Collapsible panel (300px width when expanded)
Fixed position on the right side of the screen
Smooth animation for expand/collapse
Semi-transparent background with light/dark mode support


Input Item Display:

Timestamp in compact format (HH:MM or MM/DD based on age)
First 10-15 words of input with ellipsis
Expandable to show full content
Visual indicator for bookmarked items
Hover state with highlight and "scroll to" icon


Control Panel:

Search input field at the top
Clear search button
Export selected/all/bookmarked button
Toggle for auto-collapsing when an item is clicked



Functionality Implementation

Content Extraction Logic:

Identify and extract user inputs from the DOM for each supported platform
Store input text, timestamp, and DOM reference for scrolling
Handle dynamic content loading (observe DOM changes)
Distinguish between user and AI responses


Navigation System:

Implement smooth scrolling to selected input
Highlight the selected input temporarily in the chat interface
Ensure the input is centered in the viewport when navigated to


Bookmarking System:

Toggle bookmark status with a single click
Persist bookmarks in local storage by conversation ID
Option to filter view to show only bookmarked inputs


Search Implementation:

Case-insensitive text search
Real-time filtering as user types
Clear visual indication of matched vs. filtered-out items


Export Functionality:

Export options: All inputs, Bookmarked inputs, Selected inputs
Format options: Plain text, Markdown, JSON
Copy to clipboard or download as file



Styling and UX

Clean, minimal design that works well in both light and dark environments
Use subtle animations for improved user experience
Consistent iconography following Material Design principles
Responsive design that adapts to window size changes
Non-intrusive presence that doesn't interfere with the chat interface

Performance Considerations

Throttle DOM operations for smooth performance
Efficiently handle large conversations (100+ exchanges)
Minimize memory usage by avoiding unnecessary data duplication
Use efficient selectors for DOM manipulation
Implement pagination if the number of inputs exceeds a threshold (e.g., 50)

Code Structure Guidelines

Use modern JavaScript (ES6+) with clear organization
Separate concerns: DOM manipulation, state management, UI rendering
Implement a plugin architecture for platform-specific adapters
Use event delegation for efficiently handling UI interactions
Include comprehensive error handling and fallbacks

Testing Requirements

Test on all supported platforms in various conversation states
Verify behavior with different themes/display settings
Ensure compatibility with other common extensions
Test with different conversation lengths and content types
